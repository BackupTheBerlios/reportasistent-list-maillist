Hi,

i just searched via Google for Joseph M. Newcomers CHListbox class[?]
from 2001 and found that you copied and used it unchanged within the
reportasistent, claiming "Authors: Jan Dedek, Jan Kodym, Martin Chrz,
Iva Bartunkova".

Joseph says[?]: 

,----
| The only restrictions on its use is that (a) you may not publish it as
| if it is your own, or claim authorship of it in a public or private
| declaration; (b) you may not attempt to sell it for any amount of money
| (although you are free to incorporate it into products you are selling;
| you may not sell it standalone); (c) you may not redistribute the source
| without retaining my authorship.
`----

That is not good style.

Regards,
Christoph

Oh, thank you. You are absolutely right.
This happen by a mistake during finishing source codes of the project.

I will correct that.

Thank you again.
