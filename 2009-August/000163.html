<PRE> are the more valuable, because I had employed them both, on our first
arrival in Rio, in making geological surveys of different sections on
the Dom Pedro Railroad, so that they had a great familiarity with those
formations before starting on their separate journeys. Recently, Mr. St.
John and myself having met at Para on returning from our respective
journeys, I have had an opportunity of comparing on the spot his
geological sections from the valley of the Piauhy with the Amazonian
deposits. There can be no doubt of the absolute identity of the
formations in these valleys. Having arranged the work of my assistants,
and sent several of them to collect and make geological examinations in
other directions, I myself, with the rest of my companions, proceeded up
the coast to Para. I was surprised to find at every step of my progress
the same geological phenomena which had met me at Rio. As the steamer
stops for a number of hours, or sometimes for a day or two, at Bahia,
Maceio, Pernambuco, Parahiba, Natal, Ceara, and Maranham, I had many
opportunities for observation. It was my friend Major Coutinho, already
an experienced Amazonian traveller, who first told me that this
formation continued through the whole valley of the Amazons, and was
also to be found on all of its affluents which he had visited, although
he had never thought of referring it to so recent a period. And here let
me interrupt the course of my remarks to say, that the facts recorded in
this article are by no means exclusively the result of my own
investigations. They are in great part due to this able and intelligent
young Brazilian, a member of the government corps of engineers, who, by
the kindness of the Emperor, was associated with me in my Amazonian
expedition. I can truly say that he has been my good genius throughout
the whole journey, saving me, by his pre
