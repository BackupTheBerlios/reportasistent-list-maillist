 are the more valuable, because I had employed them both, on our first
arrival in Rio, in making geological surveys of different sections on
the Dom Pedro Railroad, so that they had a great familiarity with those
formations before starting on their separate journeys. Recently, Mr. St.
John and myself having met at Para on returning from our respective
journeys, I have had an opportunity of comparing on the spot his
geological sections from the valley of the Piauhy with the Amazonian
deposits. There can be no doubt of the absolute identity of the
formations in these valleys. Having arranged the work of my assistants,
and sent several of them to collect and make geological examinations in
other directions, I myself, with the rest of my companions, proceeded up
the coast to Para. I was surprised to find at every step of my progress
the same geological phenomena which had met me at Rio. As the steamer
stops for a number of hours, or sometimes for a day or two, at Bahia,
Maceio, Pernambuco, Parahiba, Natal, Ceara, and Maranham, I had many
opportunities for observation. It was my friend Major Coutinho, already
an experienced Amazonian traveller, who first told me that this
formation continued through the whole valley of the Amazons, and was
also to be found on all of its affluents which he had visited, although
he had never thought of referring it to so recent a period. And here let
me interrupt the course of my remarks to say, that the facts recorded in
this article are by no means exclusively the result of my own
investigations. They are in great part due to this able and intelligent
young Brazilian, a member of the government corps of engineers, who, by
the kindness of the Emperor, was associated with me in my Amazonian
expedition. I can truly say that he has been my good genius throughout
the whole journey, saving me, by his pre

Ou are eclipsing Irene with your beauty." She was smiling and also
angry. Her dark gleaming eyes rose with love to the shapely face of her
son, but, striving to be dignified, she said: "Maryan, you know that I
am displeased at hearing you talk to me in such a tone." He laughed
loudly. "Then, my dear mamma, you should grow old as quickly as
possible, put on a cap, and sit in a jacket at the fireplace. I should
be filled then with timid respect, and would hurry away with all speed
from such an annoying mamma!" "But since I am not annoying you will be
good and come home with us. We shall drink tea together." "Au desespoir,
chere maman! But that cannot be. The rest of this day, or night, I have
promised to friends." "Is to-day the only time promised?" asked she,
with a shade of sadness. "For the true sage to-morrow and yesterday have
no existence," answered Maryan. They were at the open door of the
carriage; Maryan bent and kissed his mother's hand. "Be not angry, mamma
dear! But you are never angry. If there is anything on earth that I
worship yet it is your marvellous sweetness of temper." "It is
excessive," answered Malvina. "If I only knew how to dominate--" He
interrupted her, with a laugh: "I should avoid you in that ease; but
now, all relations between us are excelle

 War, however, presently supplanted medicine--the Boer troubles in South
Africa and the Boxer insurrection in China. It was a disturbing,
exciting year. ***** To W. D. Howells, in Boston: WELLINGTON COURT,
KNIGHTSBRIDGE, Jan. 25, 1900. DEAR HOWELLS,--If you got half as much as
Pond prophesied, be content and praise God--it has not happened to
another. But I am sorry he didn't go with you; for it is marvelous to
hear him yarn. He is good company, cheery and hearty, and his mill is
never idle. Your doing a lecture tour was heroic. It was the highest
order of grit, and you have a right to be proud of yourself

Mood, its shadowy beauty, its exquisite and elaborate art--this music
which drifted before the senses like iridescent vapor, suffused with
rich lights, pervasive, imponderable, evanescent. It was music at once
naive and complex, innocent and impassioned, fragile and sonorous. It
spoke with an accent unmistakably grave and sincere; yet it spoke
without emphasis: indirectly, flexibly, with fluid and unpredictable
expression. It was eloquent beyond denial, yet i
